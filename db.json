 {"description":" Imagine sitting down to dinner with a group of friends, when a laser tickles the water molecules inside your ear.You need to get home right away, your older child shouts. The younger one has fallen and cut their knee, and might need stitches.You stand up, excuse yourself, and make for the exit. Your friends have no idea why, but assume you heard a message inaudible to the rest of them in the noisy room, transmitted into your ear by laser light."}]
