The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.Richard Thomas totally condemned the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose, Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was too unlikely to have been a coincidence, Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records. Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the e-mail regime could support the freedom of information regime."}]
