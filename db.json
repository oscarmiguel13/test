The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was too unlikely to have been a coincidence, Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records. Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the e-mail regime could support the freedom of information regime.Mr Thomas said: The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence. He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas."}]
