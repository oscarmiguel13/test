But young people today might have forgotten the second reason we liked Google search back then:The Second: A clean page with a single logo and search field. It loaded quick. There were no banners everywhere, no bs.HackerNews has that feel. It is clean, information dense, and does what it needs to do. Google seems to have forgotten this and now thinks its some kind of design company. Everything with the exception of adwords and analytics it has applied material to is now garbage. News use to be my default homepage but surprisingly MSN gives me a much better product with more then 4 stories on the page on 32 monitors."}]
